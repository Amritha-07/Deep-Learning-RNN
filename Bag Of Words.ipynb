It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities,  physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.There are many different types of air pollutants,  such as gases (including ammonia,  carbon monoxide,  sulphur dioxide,  nitrous oxides,  methane,  carbon dioxide at high concentrations and chlorofluorocarbons ),  particulates ( both organic and inorganic),  and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases,  allergies,  and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops,  and may damage the natural environment (for example,  climate change,  ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example,  acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena. Air quality is closely related to the earth's climate and ecosystems globally many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e.,  burning of fossil fuel. Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases,  including respiratory infections,  heart disease,  COPD,  stroke and lung cancer [Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores,  impaired cognition,   increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health.] The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching,  but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to,  the degree of exposure,  and the individual's health status and genetics. Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually,  making it one of the top contributors to human death,  with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall,  air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year,  or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years,  and is the world's largest single environmental health risk,  which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: 90% of the world's population breathes dirty air to some degree. Although the health consequences are extensive,  the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected. Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but,  along with health and mortality impacts,  are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity,  albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules,  when properly executed,  have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level,  such as the Montreal Protocol,  which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals,  and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol,  which reduced sulphur emissions,  while others,  such as international action on climate change,  have been less successful. Air pollution is a familiar environmental health hazard. We know what we’re looking at when brown haze settles over a city,  exhaust billows across a busy highway,  or a plume rises from a smokestack. Some air pollution is not seen,  but its pungent smell alerts you. It is a major threat to global health and prosperity. Air pollution,  in all forms,  is responsible for more than 6.5 million deaths each year globally,  a number that has increased over the past two decades. Air pollution is a mix of hazardous substances from both human-made and natural sources. Vehicle emissions,  fuel oils and natural gas to heat homes,  by-products of manufacturing and power generation,  particularly coal-fueled power plants,  and fumes from chemical production are the primary sources of human-made air pollution. Nature releases hazardous substances into the air,  such as smoke from wildfires,  which are often caused by people; ash and gases from volcanic eruptions; and gases,  like methane,  which are emitted from decomposing organic matter in soils. Traffic-Related Air Pollution (TRAP),  a mixture of gasses and particles,  has most of the elements of human-made air pollution: ground-level ozone,  various forms of carbon,  nitrogen oxides,  sulfur oxides,  volatile organic compounds,  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,  and fine particulate matter. Ozone,  an atmospheric gas,  is often called smog when at ground level. It is created when pollutants emitted by cars,  power plants,  industrial boilers,  refineries,  and other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight. Noxious gases,  which include carbon dioxide,  carbon monoxide.1,  nitrogen oxides (NOx),  and sulfur oxides (SOx),  are components of motor vehicle emissions and byproducts of industrial processes. Image courtesy of EPA Particulate matter (PM) is composed of chemicals such as sulfates,  nitrates,  carbon,  or mineral dusts. Vehicle and industrial emissions from fossil fuel combustion,  cigarette smoke,  and burning organic matter,  such as wildfires,  all contain PM. A subset of PM,  fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is 30 times thinner than a human hair. It can be inhaled deeply into lung tissue and contribute to serious health problems. PM 2.5 accounts for most health effects due to air pollution in the U.S. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) vaporize at or near room temperature—hence,  the designation volatile. They are called organic because they contain carbon. VOCs are given off by paints,  cleaning supplies,  pesticides,  some furnishings,  and even craft materials like glue. Gasoline and natural gas are major sources of VOCs,  which are released during combustion. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are organic compounds containing carbon and hydrogen. Of more than 100 PAHs known to be widespread in the environment,  15 are listed in the Report on Carcinogens. In addition to combustion,  many industrial processes,  such as iron,  steel,  and rubber product manufacturing,  as well as power generation,  also produce PAHs as a by-product. PAHs are also found in particulate matter. Air Pollution and Climate Change Air pollution and climate change affect each other through complex interactions in the atmosphere. Air pollution is intricately linked with climate change because both problems come largely from the same sources, ...]\n","Index: []\n","\n","[0 rows x 192 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-dac91599-14a5-401f-bd39-802a83e4090e\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings</th>\n","      <th>or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
